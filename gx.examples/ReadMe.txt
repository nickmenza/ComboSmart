 In this folder,  some batch (*.bat) files  can be found  which can be used for
 generating  project  files  for the  tested  compilers.  If  You have  a newer
 compiler  version,  try  to  import  the  generated  old  project  files  with
 confidence.  The compiler is capable of updating  them to the current version.
 By running one of the batch files,  a solution or workspace file  is generated
 in  this  folder  and  the  necessary  project  files  are  created  in  a new
 subdirectory.
